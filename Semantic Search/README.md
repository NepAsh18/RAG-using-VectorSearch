A **Streamlit app** that performs **semantic search** on movie plots.  
Instead of searching by keywords, it searches by **meaning**, so you can find movies that *match your idea or query*, even if the exact words aren’t in the plot.

Powered by:  
- **Hugging Face Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)** for embeddings  
- **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** for fast semantic retrieval
